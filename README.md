# üåø StopDrugs NGO

A comprehensive educational platform dedicated to fighting drug harm through education while advocating for evidence-based cannabis legalization and combating decades of misinformation.

## üéØ Mission

StopDrugs is an NGO with a dual mission:

1. **Protect Lives**: Educate people about the real dangers of harmful drugs like opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, and synthetic drugs. Provide life-saving resources for addiction and recovery.

2. **Advocate for Truth**: Support evidence-based cannabis legalization by sharing scientific research and debunking propaganda. Cannabis has never caused a fatal overdose, has proven medical benefits, and is safer than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco.

3. **Fight Misinformation**: Combat decades of "Reefer Madness" propaganda with peer-reviewed science and facts.
